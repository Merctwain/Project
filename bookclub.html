		<p><b>Author</b> Ali Smith</p>
		<p><b>Description</b></p>
		
		<p>The first of four novels in a shape-shifting series, wide-ranging in timescale and light-footed through histories. 
		Fusing Keatsian mists and mellow fruitfulness with the vitality, the immediacy and the colour-hit of Pop Art--via a bit of very 
		contemporary skulduggery and skull-diggery-- Autumn is a witty excavation of the present by the past. The novel 
		is a stripped-branches take on popular culture, and a meditation, in a world growing ever more bordered and exclusive, 
		on what richness and worth are, what harvest means. Autumn is part of the quartet Seasonal: four stand-alone novels,
		separate yet interconnected and cyclical (as the seasons are), exploring what time is, how we experience it, and the 
		recurring markers in the shapes our lives take and in our ways with narrative.

		<p><b>Description</b></p>
		
		<p>Tara Westover was seventeen when she first set foot in a classroom. Instead of traditional lessons, she grew up learning how to stew herbs into medicine, 
		scavenging in the family scrap yard and helping her family prepare for the apocalypse. She had no birth certificate and no medical records and had 
		never been enrolled in school.Westover’s mother proved a marvel at concocting folk remedies for many ailments. As Tara developed her own coping mechanisms, 
		little by little, she started to realize that what her family was offering didn’t have to be her only education. Her first day of university was her first day 
		in school—ever—and she would eventually win an esteemed fellowship from Cambridge and graduate with a PhD in intellectual history and political thought.

		<p><b>Author</b> Moshin Hamid</p>
		<p><b>Description</b></p>
		
		<p>In a country teetering on the brink of civil war, two young people meet—sensual, fiercely independent Nadia and gentle, restrained Saeed. 
		They embark on a furtive love affair, and are soon cloistered in a premature intimacy by the unrest roiling their city. When it explodes, 
		turning familiar streets into a patchwork of checkpoints and bomb blasts, they begin to hear whispers about doors—doors that can whisk people far away, 
		if perilously and for a price. As the violence escalates, Nadia and Saeed decide that they no longer have a choice. Leaving their homeland and their 
		old lives behind, they find a door and step through. . . .
		</p>

		<p>Exit West follows these remarkable characters as they emerge into an alien and uncertain future, struggling to hold on to each other, to their past, to the very sense of who they are. Profoundly intimate and powerfully inventive, it tells an unforgettable story of love, loyalty, and courage that is both completely of our time and for all time.

		<p>Widowed by her husband’s death from the pestilence, Lady Anne assumes control of his people’s future—200 bonded serfs without rights of ownership to land. Strong, compassionate and resourceful—qualities she kept hidden from the husband she loathed and despised—Lady Anne chooses a bastard slave, Thaddeus Thurkell, to act as her steward. Together, they decide to quarantine Develish by bringing the serfs inside a defendable moat and sharing the available food amongst all. With this sudden overturning of the accepted social order, where serfs exist only to serve their lords, conflict arises when they’re given a voice. Ignorant of what is happening in the world outside, they wrestle with themselves, with God and the terrible uncertainty of their futures. They fear starvation when their food runs out but they fear the pestilence more. Who amongst them has the courage to leave the safety of the demesne in search of supplies and news? And how safe is anyone in Develish when an unexplained murder threatens the uneasy status quo?
